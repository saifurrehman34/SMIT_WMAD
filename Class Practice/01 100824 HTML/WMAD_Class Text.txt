Main Heading (H1)
Subheading (H2)
Another Subheading (H3)
This is a paragraph demonstrating various text styles. You can use bold text to emphasize important points, and italic text for titles or foreign words. Here, we can also underline specific words for additional emphasis.
In programming, you might encounter inline code snippets like var x = 10;, which show how to declare a variable in JavaScript. The x variable can be used later in your code. If you need to represent keyboard shortcuts, you might use Ctrl+V to paste text.
Section One: Understanding HTML Elements
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It consists of a series of elements that describe the structure of a webpage. Each element is defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, a paragraph is defined using the <p> tag.
Each element can also have attributes that provide additional information. For example, an image tag might look like this: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">. Here, src specifies the image source, and alt provides an alternative text description.
Section Two: The Importance of Semantic HTML
Using semantic HTML elements helps search engines understand the content of your webpage better. Elements like <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section> clearly define the different parts of a webpage. This not only aids in SEO but also improves accessibility for users relying on screen readers.

Section Three: CSS and Styling
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to control the layout and presentation of HTML elements. With CSS, you can change the color, font, spacing, and positioning of elements on the page. For example: body {
}
background-color: #f0f0f0;
color: #333;
This simple CSS rule changes the background color of the entire page and sets the text color to a darker shade for better readability.
