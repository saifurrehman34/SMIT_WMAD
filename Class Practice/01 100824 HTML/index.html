        <P>This is a paragraph demonstrating various text styles. You can use <b>bold</b> text to emphasize important
            points, and <i>italic</i> text for titles or foreign words. Here, we can also <u>underline</u> specific
            words for additional emphasis.</P>
        <p>In programming, you might encounter inline code snippets like var <var>x = 10</var>;, which show how to declare a
            variable in JavaScript. The x variable can be used later in your code. If you need to represent keyboard
            shortcuts, you might use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste text.</p>

        <h1>Section One: Understanding HTML Elements</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It consists of a series of elements that describe the structure of a webpage. Each element is defined by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets. For example, a paragraph is defined using the <p> tag.</p>
